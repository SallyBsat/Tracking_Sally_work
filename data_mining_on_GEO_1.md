## AIM



new lines added here

#### Meeting on 24/06/2022
check for different ChipSeq datasets of polycomb factors RING1B, SUZ12, EZH1/2, EED, RYBP and the histone modiffication associated to them. Compare their ChipSeq profile across different tumor cell lines and check if there are any changes. Record the (GSE nb), (paper), and (SRA nb). (only huaman cancer cell line)

### Things to take into consideration


**==A) How to think  during and after data mining**

 Here should think about the question and what I can do to represent it and should think about different ways to represent it like boxplot or heatmap or igv. What is the main question.


**==B) Terms to understand**


SRA is general and GSE is general
SRX is specific to each GSM 

SRA (SRP..) has many SRX
GSE has many GSM

here I need to save SRA and not SRX but I need SRX from SRA Run selector tp select the ones I am interested in in form of txt file showing metadata

In the beginning I saw that SRA leads me to the fastq files and GSM is assigned for every sample that has a .bw file for  a Chipseq experiment on geo so I thought that I can do the data mining from .bw files however I have to start from fastq files (pipeline) and use these files to generate my own .bw files using the pipeline.


**==C) what Diego wants me to do?**

1) Check change in binding profile of polycomb protein 
in maybe (CpG islands and promoter regions)

2) Call peaks , see in CpG island or promoter (but when I said call peaks Andrea told me I am mixing stuff when we were in the meeting )


**==D) Andrea told me about this tool about he has never read and used it before so he does not know if it is useful, it might help me in finding papers**


[A tool to find sequencing data and metadata from public databases](https://github.com/pachterlab/ffq)
